# Sumo-Car
School Project "Sumo Car" - an arduino car project.

## Idea
The idea behind this project is to create a sumo car, or the so called "Battle Bot".
The initial idea was to create a bluetooth controlled robot, but we decided to use IR sensors since TinkerCAD doesn't have a bluetooth module.
